#### Factory Pattern
- Useful when you want another class to create objects for you.
- Clients need not know the details of how to create every object it needs.
- Delegates the responsibility of knowing how to create the objects to the Factory class.

# Things to remember:
- How Enums are really classes in Java, so you can do things like define methods and abstract methods in Enums...
